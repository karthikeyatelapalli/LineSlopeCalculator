# Slope of a Line Calculator

This Python program calculates the slope of a line connecting two points in a 2D coordinate system. The user provides the coordinates of two points, and the program computes the slope using the formula:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]

## **Features**
1. **User Input**:
   - Prompts the user to enter the coordinates of two points:
     - First point \((x_1, y_1)\)
     - Second point \((x_2, y_2)\)

2. **Slope Calculation**:
   - Calculates the slope using the formula:
     \[
     \text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
     \]

3. **Output**:
   - Displays the slope along with the two points.
